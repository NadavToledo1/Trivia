# Trivia Game Server and Client

This is a trivia game implemented using Python, consisting of a server and a client application.

## Server

The server application (`server.py`) hosts the trivia game and manages connections with multiple clients. It broadcasts trivia questions to connected clients and waits for their responses. The server determines the correct answer and declares the winner if a client answers correctly within a specified time limit.

## Client

The client application (`client.py`) connects to the server to participate in the trivia game. Clients receive trivia questions from the server and submit their answers within the given time frame. If a client answers correctly, the server declares them the winner.
